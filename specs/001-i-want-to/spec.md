# Feature Specification: ComponentReady Ruby Gem - Modern Web Component Library

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: October 2, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a ruby gem that give user components ready for building a modern webpage. The gem will contain components like button, slider, footer, pricing, login, banner, etc, in short this gem is heavy inspired by shadcn components but not use same tech, this gem will contain component made from purely traditional css tailwind. The goal is simplify building modern views in rails app, fast and efficiency for solo dev"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input ‚úì
   ‚Üí Feature description provided: Ruby gem for modern web components
2. Extract key concepts from description ‚úì
   ‚Üí Actors: Solo developers, Rails applications
   ‚Üí Actions: Install gem, use components, build modern views
   ‚Üí Data: Component templates, styling, configurations
   ‚Üí Constraints: Tailwind CSS only, Rails integration, ease of use
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Component customization level needs clarification
   ‚Üí Installation and setup process needs definition
   ‚Üí Component API and usage patterns need specification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section ‚úì
5. Generate Functional Requirements ‚úì
6. Identify Key Entities ‚úì
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec contains some [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers for precision
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a solo Rails developer, I want to quickly integrate modern, pre-styled web components into my application so that I can build professional-looking interfaces efficiently without spending time on custom CSS design and component architecture.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Rails application with Tailwind CSS setup, **When** I install the ComponentReady gem, **Then** I can immediately access a library of modern UI components
2. **Given** I need a login form for my application, **When** I use the ComponentReady login component, **Then** I get a fully styled, responsive login form that integrates seamlessly with my Rails views
3. **Given** I want to customize component appearance, **When** I modify component parameters or classes, **Then** the component adapts while maintaining its design integrity
4. **Given** I'm building a landing page, **When** I combine multiple ComponentReady components (header, pricing, footer), **Then** they work together cohesively to create a professional webpage
5. **Given** I'm working on mobile responsiveness, **When** I use ComponentReady components, **Then** they automatically provide responsive behavior across different screen sizes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Tailwind CSS is not properly configured in the Rails application?
- How does the system handle conflicts with existing CSS classes or custom styles?
- What occurs when a component is used in an unexpected context or with invalid parameters?
- How are components maintained and updated without breaking existing implementations?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a collection of pre-built UI components including buttons, sliders, footers, pricing tables, login forms, and banners
- **FR-002**: System MUST integrate seamlessly with Rails view rendering system
- **FR-003**: Components MUST be styled exclusively with Tailwind CSS classes for consistency and customizability
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow developers to customize component appearance through parameters or class overrides
- **FR-005**: Components MUST be responsive and work across different screen sizes
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear documentation and usage examples for each component
- **FR-007**: Components MUST maintain consistent design language and visual hierarchy
- **FR-008**: System MUST be installable as a standard Ruby gem with minimal configuration
- **FR-009**: Components MUST support WCAG 2 and above
- **FR-010**: System MUST follow semantic versioning with backward compatibility maintained within major versions, ensuring existing component calls continue to work when upgrading minor/patch versions
- **FR-011**: Components MUST support predefined color themes (primary, secondary, success, warning, danger) with the ability to override individual color properties and extend with custom Tailwind CSS classes for advanced customization
- **FR-012**:  System MUST provide comprehensive static documentation including installation guide, component reference with code examples, and parameter documentation, supplemented by a demo Rails application showcasing all components with their variations and usage patterns

### Key Entities
- **Component**: Represents a reusable UI element with predefined styling and behavior, includes attributes for customization, responsive design rules, and Tailwind class configurations
- **Component Library**: The collection of all available components, organized by category (navigation, forms, layout, content, etc.)
- **Component Configuration**: Settings and parameters that control component appearance and behavior, including size variants, color schemes, and layout options
- **Rails Integration**: The mechanism that allows components to be rendered within Rails views, including helper methods and view partials
- **Documentation Entry**: Information about component usage, parameters, examples, and integration guidelines for each component
